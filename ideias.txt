
The code is already doing well in terms of functionality, but there are several potential optimizations for both performance and readability. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Reduce Redundant Calculations
OK - Recalculate FPS Efficiently: Instead of calculating the FPS for each frame (which involves taking time stamps on every frame), you can calculate FPS every few frames or every second to reduce unnecessary computations.
Avoid Repeated Conversion: You convert the filtered frame to grayscale on every iteration, which can be expensive. Instead, you could convert the frame to grayscale once and then apply the color filter in the same step.
2. Optimize Line Detection
Limit the Hough Transform Search Area: The Hough Line Transform can be computationally expensive, especially for large images. You can optimize it by focusing only on areas that are more likely to contain lines (such as limiting it to certain regions of interest, like the bottom half of the image for lane detection).
Tune Parameters: The parameters used in cv2.HoughLinesP (e.g., threshold, minLineLength, and maxLineGap) can significantly impact both the number of lines detected and performance. You can experiment with these values to get better performance with minimal loss in accuracy.
3. Parallel Processing
Use Multiple Threads: If you are working with a multi-core processor, you can parallelize certain tasks like frame processing, filtering, or Hough Transform. Libraries like OpenCV and concurrent.futures can help speed things up by processing frames concurrently.
4. Memory Management
Efficient Masking: Instead of creating separate masks for gray, yellow, and white and then combining them, you can combine the masks in one step to save some memory and time.
Release Unnecessary Variables: After using certain variables (e.g., edges, blurred), you can release memory if they’re no longer needed, especially in high-volume video processing scenarios.
5. Better Line Grouping
Avoid Redundant Line Checking: The group_similar_lines function can be optimized by implementing more efficient distance and slope thresholding. Using geometric approaches (such as clustering) to group lines might reduce duplicate line detections.
6. Use OpenCV GPU Acceleration (Optional)
Leverage OpenCV’s GPU Modules: If you are using a compatible GPU, OpenCV offers GPU-based implementations of certain functions (such as cv2.cuda) that could greatly improve performance for large videos or high-resolution frames.
